#### Abstract 

### Open signal processing software platform for hearing aid research (openMHA)     

###### Tobias Herzke, Hendrik Kayser, Frasher Loshaj, Giso Grimm and Volker Hohmann

Hearing aids help hearing impaired users participate in the communication society. Development and improvement of hearing aid signal processing algorithms takes place in the industry and in academic research. With openMHA, we present a development and evaluation platform that is able to execute hearing aid signal processing in real-time on standard computing hardware with a low delay between sound input and output. We lay out the application specific requirements and present how openMHA meets these and will be helpful in future research in the field of signal processing for hearing aids.
